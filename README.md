# Max-Lloyd-quantization
Computes Max Lloyd two dimensional vector quantization sets to minimize quantization errors with respect to the probability density of the two dimenstional random vector

The probability density function of the vector follows the surfaces shown in the image.

The surfaces are symmetric with respect to the axes.

You will be asked to input values of n1-n6, as well as ratios of the probabilities of the three surfaces (p1,p2,p3).

The program can easily diverge due to random initialization.
